# Vocaire Coding Challenge

Hey, thanks for taking the time to complete this coding challenge! If you have any questions regarding it, you are always welcome to contact me via email.

This challenge has two parts:

- Part 1 is a small coding task with APIs and some CSS.
- Part 2 is a small questionnaire.

# Submission

For clarity, please fork this Git repository and create your own branch to work from.

Once done, send me (peter@vocaire.ai) a link to your **public** fork.

# Challenges

## Part 1 -- CSS and Forms

For this part, please focus on the UI/UX aspects. Do not over-engineer the code; the emphasis here is on being quick and providing the user with a great experience!

Use a CSS library of your choice. I recommend either [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) or [Tabler](https://tabler.io).

### Create a project using any of the following frameworks:

- React
- Vue
- Svelte
- Angular

### The project should only contain one page with a form

No need to implement any routes.

### On this form page, obtain the following information from the user:

- Organization
- Name
- Email
- Phone Number

### Validate the obtained values on the frontend, checking if the details are 'real' with a 'degree' of certainty

The endpoint below does not perform any validation.

### The form needs to be submitted with the details below:

```bash
POST https://europe-west1-vocaire-main.cloudfunctions.net/student_test
```

```typescript
export type StudentRequestBody = {
  org: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  phone: string;
};
```

## Part 2 -- Questionnaire

1. If this project were to be used with 'real' users, it would have a couple of design flaws. Can you point out at least one?
   - [There should be data-validation on the backend]
   - [Gonna be honest, I am not a designer - I am up for to get a figma file and make it real]


2. Suppose you are working with OAuth2 tokens. How much time do you have from the point of issuance until they expire? Please provide an answer for both access and refresh tokens.
   - [Access token has a short expiration date - minutes, max an hour, because this is used for authentication. It reduces the risk for an unauthorized person to access to this token. Refresh token is alive much longer, because the user is authenticated now.]

   - [Sorry, I cannot read ASCII characters just like this - I needed to ask my newest mentor - ChatGPT :D So I would say the coolest new tech out there is definitely AI-driven technologies. Vocaire is in the right direction, using new tech to make life easier to PT :D ]
